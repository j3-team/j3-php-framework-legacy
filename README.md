# j3-php-framework

j3 is a PHP framework intended to make the building of webapps quicker and easier.

We are working to make a new version of j3 right now. Please use the current version just to test, issues and bugs here will not be solved!

# Installation

For now there is no installer, to make j3 to work, you need to download the source code and put it in your htmldocs folder (/var/www is the most common folder in Linux).
